*--------------------------------
*The Supertex LND150 is a popular hobbyist transistor because it is depletion 
*mode, N-channel and has similar working voltage and current ranges and similar 
*transconductance to small thermionic valves (vacuum tubes).
*
*However the only spice model available as far as I have seen is an NMOS model 
*from the manufacturer. If this was the heart of a subcircuit model, that would 
*be fine, but on its own it's completely inadequate. Without any extra components 
*of a subcircuit, its characteristic curves are way off, as are its capacitances, 
*so it's not much use to hobbyists. I therefore remade the model from the 
*datasheet as a simpler VDMOS model.
*
*Gfs and Rds(on) are the typical values from the datasheet of 2mS and 850R 
*respectively.
*
*Source resistance and body diode parameters are not included and will
*revert to default values.
